Reason for 100km threshold... in WSPRLogSplitter... 

among other phenomena is the frequent report by 2E0NGV from
G6CMV on 30m.  The contacts tend to appear at the same time every
morning (solar time) +/- a few minutes.  The two stations are
7km apart.  with the reported SNR in excess of 10dB (often 20 dB).
These reports are unlikely caused by any propagation effects.

It may make sense to do a SNR threshold for the primary signal, to
avoid such problems.  But the distance threshold may be sufficient.

(This effect was discovered while looking at odds ratio for non line
frequency offsets (img_D reports) vs. solar time.  Normally there is
an odds-boost at solar rise, but there were peaks at 02:45 solar time
+/- that were way beyond reasonable expectation.  All were accounted
for by what appears to be a standard pattern where 2E0NGV would report
about a dozen images from G6CMV.  These appear to be symmetric about
the main lobe and spaced at 12Hz intervals more or less. There were
46 such contacts in the March 2018 log for 30m. This was sufficient to
greatly skew the statistics. The reports all occurred on March 4, 2018
with most reported at 22:20 or 22:10 UTC.)
